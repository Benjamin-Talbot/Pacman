GAME "AI"

If any ghost is within a certain distance from pacman:
(make sure to check vector, not only components, otherwise if on same line/column would indicate bad)
    should try to avoid
    If multiple ghosts are close:
        ...

If no ghosts close:
    go for closest pellet
    If multiple closest pellets:
        calculate combined vector and go for one which is less in that direction
