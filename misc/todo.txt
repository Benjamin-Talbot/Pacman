To Do:
- add fruit (cherries, strawberries, etc.)
- automate the process of creating powerups and ghosts?
- check misc.txt for order of operations
- use free()
- make chance that if ghost sees pacman will not follow
- create ghost home struct?
- make map loading automatic with different rows and columns
  first maybe using numbers at top of file or straight up until \n and if exists
- look into windows


- How to use elems as 2D array, but as pointers?
- How to malloc powerups, ghosts, etc., with (pGhost) sizeof(Ghost) or (Ghost) sizeof(Ghost)?
- Bug with variables being overwritten
