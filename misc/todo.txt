To Do:
- check when out of powerups
- add fruit (cherries, strawberries, etc.)
- pacman hitting ghost is buggy (go straight down BESIDE ghost)
- check misc.txt for order of operations
- use free()
- make chance that if ghost sees pacman will not follow
- create ghost home struct?
- look into windows
- don't delete char moved from unless ghost, same for ghosts
- implement bounds checking in case at edges
