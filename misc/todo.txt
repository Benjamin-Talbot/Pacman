Pressing issues:
- make ghosts follow pacman
- make ghosts wait in hub until timeout?
Then:
- Autoplay

-- Advanced Requirements (100%?) --
Multiple stages with increasing difficulty
Use of C features:

To Do:
- are tied scores always returned in the same order?
- check when out of powerups
- don't delete char moved from unless ghost, same for ghosts
- see if can make macros for left/right/up/down for direction

- Terminating character at end of scores file?
- this->invincible-- vs (this->invincible)--
- add fruit (cherries, strawberries, etc.)
- check misc.txt for order of operations
- make chance that if ghost sees pacman will not follow
- create ghost home struct?
- look into windows
- implement bounds checking in case at edges
