PRESSING ISSUES:
- make random chance to go random direction when ghosts running from pacman
- test whether ghosts still vulnerable if eaten and respawn w/ toggleUpdate, + general testing
- addition of checking upon collision for cooldown broken

THEN:
- Autoplay



LOOK INTOS:
- make directions and numchoices global again
- add colors so can know when invincible, ghosts vulnerable, etc
- fix segfault in loadScore sometimes segfaults at fgetc ???
- fix ghosts going through walls
- look into windows
- are tied scores always returned in the same order?
- make ghosts wait in hub until timeout, hub struct?
- add fruit (cherries, strawberries, etc.)
