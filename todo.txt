PRESSING ISSUES:
- fix ghosts going through walls
- fix segfault in loadScore sometimes segfaults at fgetc ???
- eating ghosts only gives 200, not double
- ghosts still chase pacman when he's invincible

THEN:
- Autoplay



LOOK INTOS:
- make directions and numchoices global again
- add colors so can know when invincible, ghosts vulnerable, etc
- look into windows
- are tied scores always returned in the same order?
- make ghosts wait in hub until timeout, hub struct?
- add fruit (cherries, strawberries, etc.)
