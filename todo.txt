PRESSING ISSUES:
- fix ghosts going through walls
- fix segfault in loadScore
    sometimes segfaults at fgetc
- map2 not loading sometimes
    then segfaults when move in some directions (go through spaces)
- fix segfault in loadMap (still exists?)
- when ghosts reset, can still be eaten
- eating ghosts only gives 200, not double
- ghosts still chase pacman when he's invincible

THEN:
- Autoplay
- make directions and numchoices global again



LOOK INTOS:
- look into windows
- are tied scores always returned in the same order?
- make ghosts wait in hub until timeout, hub struct?
- add fruit (cherries, strawberries, etc.)
