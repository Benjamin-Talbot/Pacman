- Autoplay
- somehow a ghost still went diagonally
  check map0.txt for ghost init locations and ghost move function in case [1, 1] as direction doesn't move into a wall, but an open space
  other ghosts do this too


LOOK INTOS:
- test empty name and w/ :
- once ghost managed to get inside closed loop
- rarely, but sometimes can't eat ghost when invincible?
- make directions and numchoices global again
- add colors so can know when invincible, ghosts vulnerable, etc
- fix segfault in loadScore sometimes segfaults at fgetc ???
- fix ghosts going through walls
- look into windows
- are tied scores always returned in the same order?
- make ghosts wait in hub until timeout, hub struct?
- add fruit (cherries, strawberries, etc.)
